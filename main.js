// Function takes in an array of integers. The array can vary in length. Count the amount of odd numbers and even numbers.
// Return which ever count is higher e.g
//     -if there are more even numbers than odd, then return the amount of even numbers
//     -if there are more odd numbers than even, then return the amount of odd numbers
//     -if the amount of odd and even numbers are the same, then return a string saying "Equal".


//ğŸ‘‰ Write the function your CodeWarriors will start with below here:

export default function oddOrEven(array){
    return count;
}
